Data Types in Java-----


Data types in Java are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.

1. Primitive Data Types:

byte: 1-byte integer values with a range of -128 to 127.
short: 2-byte integer values with a range of -32,768 to 32,767.
int: 4-byte integer values with a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
long: 8-byte integer values with a range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
float: 4-byte floating-point values used for decimal numbers with single-precision.
double: 8-byte floating-point values used for decimal numbers with double-precision.
char: 2-byte Unicode characters, such as 'A' or '1'.
boolean: Represents a true or false value.
2. Reference Data Types:

Reference data types are used to store references to objects and include classes, interfaces, and arrays.
Classes and interfaces are user-defined data types created using the class and interface keywords.
Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type, which can store primitive or reference data types.
java
Copy code
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
}

Person person1 = new Person();
In the above example, Person is a reference data type, and person1 is an instance of the Person class.

3. String Data Type:

Strings are objects in Java and not considered primitive data types.
The String class is used to work with text, representing sequences of characters.
Strings are widely used for storing and manipulating textual data and can be concatenated, split, and operated upon in various ways.
java
Copy code
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
4. Automatic Type Conversion (Type Casting):

Java allows automatic type conversion (widening conversion) from smaller data types to larger data types without loss of information.
Explicit type casting is required when converting from larger data types to smaller data types, which may result in data loss.
java
Copy code
double num1 = 10.5;
int num2 = (int) num1; // Explicit type casting   - when you seecify something
5. Literal Values:

Literal values are constants representing specific values in Java, e.g., 42 is an int literal.
Suffixes can be added to literals to specify their data type, e.g., 42L for a long literal.
java
Copy code
int a = 42;
long b = 42L;
In Java, understanding data types is essential for writing efficient and correct code. The choice of data type affects memory usage and program behavior, so it's crucial to select the appropriate data type for each variable and operation

 --------------------------------

 Operators in Java

Operators in Java are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. Operators are an essential part of Java programming and are classified into various categories, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and more.

1. Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical calculations.
Common arithmetic operators include:
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus, returns the remainder)
java
Copy code
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
int sum = a + b; // 13
int difference = a - b; // 7
int product = a * b; // 30
int quotient = a / b; // 3
int remainder = a % b; // 1
2. Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
Common assignment operators include:
= (Assignment)
+= (Addition assignment)
-= (Subtraction assignment)
*= (Multiplication assignment)
/= (Division assignment)
%= (Modulus assignment)
java
Copy code
int x = 5;
x += 3; // Equivalent to x = x + 3; (x becomes 8)
3. Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions.
Common comparison operators include:
== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
< (Less than)
> (Greater than)
<= (Less than or equal to)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
java
Copy code
int m = 10;
int n = 5;
boolean isEqual = m == n; // false
boolean isGreaterThan = m > n; // true
4. Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions.
Common logical operators include:
&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)
java
Copy code
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean result = a && b; // false
boolean anotherResult = !a; // false (negation)
5. Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise operators work on individual bits of integers.
Common bitwise operators include:
& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
>>> (Unsigned right shift)
java
Copy code
int x = 5; // Binary: 0101
int y = 3; // Binary: 0011
int result = x & y; // 1 (Binary: 0001, AND operation)
6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:

The conditional operator (ternary operator) is used for simple decision making.
It has the form condition ? expression1 : expression2, and it returns expression1 if the condition is true, otherwise expression2.
java
Copy code
int age = 18;
String message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
7. instanceof Operator:

The instanceof operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.
java
Copy code
if (myObject instanceof MyClass) {
    // Do something
}
8. Other Operators:

Java also provides other operators like the sizeof operator (used with byte and short data types), the instanceof operator (for type checking), and the :: operator (used in method references).
Understanding and using operators correctly is fundamental to writing effective Java programs. They allow you to manipulate data, make decisions, and perform various tasks in your code.
----------------------------------------
Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements in Java allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. You can execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false. Java supports several types of conditional statements, including if, if-else, if-else if-else, and the switch statement.

1. if Statement:

The if statement is the simplest form of conditional statement in Java.
It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
java
Copy code
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
}
2. if-else Statement:

The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
java
Copy code
int age = 15;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
3. if-else if-else Statement:

The if-else if-else statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check.
It allows you to specify multiple conditions and execute different code blocks depending on which condition is true.
java
Copy code
int score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
    System.out.println("A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    System.out.println("B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    System.out.println("C");
} else {
    System.out.println("F");
}
4. switch Statement:

The switch statement is used to test a variable against a list of values (cases) and execute code based on the matching case.
It provides a more structured way to handle multiple conditions compared to if-else if-else.
java
Copy code
int day = 3;
String dayName;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}
5. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:

The conditional operator (ternary operator) is a concise way to express conditional statements in a single line.
It has the form condition ? expression1 : expression2 and returns expression1 if the condition is true, otherwise expression2.
java
Copy code
int age = 18;
String message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
6. Nested Conditional Statements:

You can nest conditional statements within one another to create more complex decision-making logic.
java
Copy code
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
if (x > 5) {
    if (y > 2) {
        System.out.println("Both conditions are true.");
    }
}
Understanding and effectively using conditional statements is crucial for controlling the flow of your Java programs and making decisions based on different conditions. These constructs help you create flexible and responsive code.
---------------------------------------
Loops in Java

Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met. Java provides three main types of loops: for, while, and do-while.

1. for Loop:

The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code.
It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
2. while Loop:

The while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
The condition is checked before entering the loop.
java
Copy code
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
}
3. do-while Loop:

The do-while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
The condition is checked after executing the loop.
java
Copy code
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
Loop Control Statements:

Java provides loop control statements to alter the flow of loops.
Common loop control statements include:
break: Terminates the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
return: Exits a method or function, which can effectively exit a loop as well.
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // Exits the loop when i equals 3.
    }
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
Nested Loops:

You can nest loops inside one another to create more complex control structures.
java
Copy code
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        System.out.print(i * j + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
Enhanced for Loop (for-each):

The enhanced for loop is used for iterating over elements in arrays or collections.
It simplifies the process of iterating over a collection.
java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
Infinite Loops:

Be cautious when creating loops to avoid infinite loops (loops that never terminate). Use proper loop control statements to ensure termination.
java
Copy code
while (true) {
    // Infinite loop, be careful!
}
Loops are essential for repetitive tasks in programming. They provide a way to automate tasks that need to be performed multiple times. Properly using loops can make your code more efficient and concise.
---------------------------------
Arrays in Java

Arrays in Java are a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous memory location. Arrays are widely used in Java for organizing and manipulating data efficiently.

Declaring Arrays:
To declare an array in Java, you specify the data type of its elements followed by square brackets []. You can declare arrays for any data type, including primitive types and reference types.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers; // Declares an integer array
String[] names; // Declares a string array
double[] prices; // Declares a double array
Creating Arrays:
To create an array, you need to allocate memory for it using the new keyword. The size of the array should be specified when creating it.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Creates an integer array of size 5
String[] names = new String[3]; // Creates a string array of size 3
double[] prices = new double[10]; // Creates a double array of size 10
Initializing Arrays:
You can initialize an array at the time of creation or later by assigning values to its elements.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes an integer array
String[] days = new String[7];
days[0] = "Sunday";
days[1] = "Monday";
// ... and so on
Accessing Array Elements:
Array elements are accessed using the index, which starts from 0 for the first element.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Retrieves the first element (10)
int thirdNumber = numbers[2]; // Retrieves the third element (30)
Array Length:
You can find the length of an array using the length property.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int length = numbers.length; // Gets the length of the array (5)
Iterating Through Arrays:
You can use loops, such as for or enhanced for loops, to iterate through array elements.

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}

// Enhanced for loop (for-each):
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
Multidimensional Arrays:
Java supports multidimensional arrays, allowing you to create arrays of arrays. For example, a 2D array is an array of arrays, forming a grid-like structure.

java
Copy code
int[][] grid = new int[3][3]; // Creates a 3x3 grid
grid[0][0] = 1;
grid[1][1] = 2;
// ...
Arrays are powerful and versatile data structures that are used extensively in Java. They provide a simple way to store and manipulate collections of data. Understanding how to work with arrays is a fundamental skill for any Java programmer.

Note: In Java, arrays have a fixed size. If you need a dynamic collection, consider using other data structures like ArrayList or LinkedList.

Certainly! Here are complete notes on 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays in Java:

1. 1D Array:

A 1D array, or one-dimensional array, is a linear collection of elements of the same data type.
In Java, you declare and create a 1D array using square brackets [].
Declaring and Creating a 1D Array:

java
Copy code
int[] numbers; // Declares an integer array
numbers = new int[5]; // Creates an integer array of size 5
Initializing and Accessing Elements:

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Initializes an integer array
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accesses the first element (10)
int thirdNumber = numbers[2]; // Accesses the third element (30)
2. 2D Array:

A 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is an array of arrays, forming a grid-like structure.
It is used to store data in rows and columns, suitable for representing tables, matrices, or game boards.
Declaring and Creating a 2D Array:

java
Copy code
int[][] grid; // Declares a 2D integer array
grid = new int[3][3]; // Creates a 3x3 grid of integers

int[][] grid = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
}; // Initializes a 3x3 grid

int element = grid[1][2]; // Accesses the element in the second row, third column (6)
3. 3D Array:

A 3D array, or three-dimensional array, is an array of 2D arrays. It is used to store data in a cuboid structure, suitable for representing volumes, 3D graphics, or simulations.
Declaring and Creating a 3D Array:

java
Copy code
int[][][] cube; // Declares a 3D integer array
cube = new int[2][2][2]; // Creates a 2x2x2 cube of integers
Initializing and Accessing Elements:

java
Copy code
int[][][] cube = {
    {
        {1, 2},
        {3, 4}
    },
    {
        {5, 6},
        {7, 8}
    }
}; // Initializes a 2x2x2 cube

int element = cube[1][0][1]; // Accesses the element in the second layer, first row, second column (6)
Iterating Through 2D and 3D Arrays:

java
Copy code
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};

for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
In Java, 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays are used for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. They are essential for working with tabular data, images, simulations, and many other applications where data needs to be organized in multiple dimensions. Understanding and using multidimensional arrays is an important skill for Java programmers.
----------------------------------
Strings in Java

Strings are a fundamental data type in Java used to represent sequences of characters. In Java, strings are objects of the String class, and they have several important features and methods for manipulating and working with text.

1. Declaring and Initializing Strings:

You can declare and initialize strings using double quotes "".
java
Copy code
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
2. String Concatenation:

You can concatenate strings using the + operator.
java
Copy code
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"
3. String Length:

You can find the length of a string using the length() method.
java
Copy code
String text = "This is a sample string";
int length = text.length(); // 24
4. Common String Methods:

Java provides numerous methods for manipulating strings, including:
charAt(index): Retrieves the character at the specified index.
substring(start, end): Extracts a substring.
toLowerCase() and toUpperCase(): Converts the string to lowercase or uppercase.
trim(): Removes leading and trailing white spaces.
equals(otherString): Compares strings for equality.
startsWith(prefix) and endsWith(suffix): Checks if a string starts or ends with a specified prefix or suffix.
contains(substring): Checks if a string contains a specific substring.
indexOf(substring): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
replace(oldStr, newStr): Replaces occurrences of one substring with another.
java
Copy code
String sentence = "Java is a popular programming language.";
char firstChar = sentence.charAt(0); // 'J'
String lang = sentence.substring(0, 4); // "Java"
String lowerCase = sentence.toLowerCase(); // "java is a popular programming language."
String noSpaces = "  Trim this string  ".trim(); // "Trim this string"
5. String Comparison:

In Java, you should use the equals() or equalsIgnoreCase() method for string comparison, as the == operator compares references, not the contents of strings.
java
Copy code
String str1 = "hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2); // false
boolean isEqualIgnoreCase = str1.equalsIgnoreCase(str2); // true
6. String Splitting:

You can split a string into an array of substrings using the split() method.
java
Copy code
String sentence = "This is a sample sentence.";
String[] words = sentence.split(" "); // ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence."]
7. String Building:

For efficient string concatenation, you can use the StringBuilder class to build and modify strings without creating many intermediate string objects.
java
Copy code
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
builder.append("Hello");
builder.append(", ");
builder.append("World!");
String result = builder.toString(); // "Hello, World!"
8. Immutable Strings:

In Java, strings are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. Any modification results in a new string object.
9. String Literals:

Java optimizes memory usage by reusing string literals, ensuring that identical string literals share the same memory space.
Strings are a vital part of Java programming, used for text processing, data representation, and much more. Understanding how to work with strings effectively is crucial for building robust and efficient Java applications.
